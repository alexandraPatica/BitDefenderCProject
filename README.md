# BitDefenderCProject

## Objective

This repository was created to store and display the updated versions of the mandatory project from the [BitDefender](https://www.bitdefender.ro/) C learning project. 
The task is to build an DLL library implementation solution for the following topics:
* Vectors
* Stack
* Trees( binary)
* Heap
* HashTable

## Current Development

The following libraries are partially or fully implemented:
* Vectors
* Stack ( dependencies: Vectors)
* Trees ( normal binary search tree implementation)
* Heap ( dependencies: Vectors)
* common.h where all the common functions are declared and implemented in common.c. To help with the development, there is a boolean type variable, a quicksort implementation with partitions and a swap variables function

To implement:
* HashTable
* AVL Tree implementation for the BST
